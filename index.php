                <h3 class="dropdown-title">Quality Batting List:</h3>
                <p class="bold italicize batting-type">100% Polyester</p>
                <p><span class="italicize">3/8" Thick</span>
                    <br>
                    This is a very soft batt with just enough loft for a baby quilt or comforter. It's a step up from a flat batt. Very reasonable in price and a great choice for those that want a flat batt, but not the higher price. We can do more quilting on this batt to try to give the look of a flat batt; or we can do "airy" quilting to give it a loftier look.
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold comment">48" wide $4.49/yard</span>
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold comment">96" wide $6.49/yard</span>
                </p>

                <p><span class="italicize">1/2" Thick</span>
                    <br>
                    This is a denser batting. To best retain the loft of the polyester, less quilting is required (a more "airy" quilting). The more quilting that is done close together will make the quilt stiff and loose it's flexibility. Overall, this batt makes a nice comforter look and great for edge to edge quilting designs.
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold comment">48" wide $5.49/yard</span>
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold comment">96" wide $8.49/yard</span>
                </p>

                <p class="bold italicize batting-type">Hobbs 80% Cotton/20% Poly</p>
                <p>
                    This batt is very versatile. It is lightly needle punched and lightly resin bonded. It shrinks less than other cotton battings and has a little more loft. Great for machine quilting and soft enough for hand quilting (quilt up to 3 1/2" apart).
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold comment">96" wide $8.99/yard</span>
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold comment">120" wide $12.99/yard</span>
                </p>

                <p class="bold italicize batting-type">Hobbs 100% Cotton with Scrim</p>
                <p>
                    This batt is a great flat batt, very similar to Warm & Natural. The polypropylene scrim bonding makes it possible to quilt up to 8-10 inches apart. We don't recommend this batt for hand quilting, but it is great for machine quilting.

                <h3 class="dropdown-title">Is your quilt ready?</h3>
                <p class="bold italicize">Did you use 100% cotton, high-quality fabric to help prevent irregular stitches?
                    <ul>
                        <li>For best results, <span class="bold">we recommend using 100% cotton, high-quality fabric</span>. Quilt shop quality fabric does make a difference.
                            <br>If made of polyester-blend, tricot, denim or knit fabrics, the finished quilt may exhibit unavoidable stitching irregularities, stretching, or fabric running. Also, it is common for these fabrics to cause extra needle breakages and machine adjustments for tension setting and needle changes, <span class="bold">requiring additional time and cost</span>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="bold italicize">Does your quilt top lay flat, free from puckering, stretched quilt blocks, or fullness in the borders?
                <ul>
                    <li>We can do our best workmanship when your quilt top will lay flat, free from puckering, stretched quilt blocks, or fullness in the borders. A <span class="bold">neatly pressed wrinkle-free quilt top</span> will make a nicer looking quilt in the end and cause fewer problems for the machine quilter.
                        <br>If you do have a few problems in your piecing, we can assist you in choosing the proper batting to minimize the problem. It is also helpful to <span class="bold">have loose threads clipped</span> because they can interfere with the operation of the quilting machine.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="bold italicize">Are all of your loose threads clipped?
                <ul>
                    <li>It is helpful to have loose threads clipped because they can interfere with the operation of the quilting machine.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="bold italicize">Is your backing fabric 4" larger on all sides?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Select a backing fabric that will blend with your dominate thread color. For more efficient quilting, we use the same thread on both the top and bottom of the quilt. The backing fabric needs to be 4" larger on all sides; this provides us with the extra fabric needed for mounting the quilt to the frame and centering your quilt if needed.
                        <br><br>
                        If your backing fabric needs to be pieced together, stitch a 1-inch seam allowance, trim the selvage edge, and press open to distribute the thickness of the seam.
                        <br><br>
                        If you need to add an additional strip of a fabric to the back, it is more attractive to your finished quilt to not have the additional seam less than 12" to 18" from the edge of your fabric. This will give the appearance that the backing fabric was planned. Adding borders around your backing fabric to enlarge the backing size is not recommended because it is impossible to center your quilt top in a specific area of the backing fabric on the long arm quilting frame.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="bold italicize">Have you selected a thread color that compliments your quilt top fabrics?
                <ul>
                    <li>We use the same thread on both the top & bottom of your quilt. Select a thread color that compliments your quilt top fabrics from our variety of thread options. Our machine quilters will be glad to help you make your thread selection. The proper thread selection is essential to an attractive quilt.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="bold italicize">Do you have any embellishments you'd like to add?
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are adding embellishments to your quilt, it is best to stitch them on after your quilt has been quilted. Adding them to the top before it is quilted may interfere with machine quilting and could damage your quilt.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="bold italicize">Have you ensured your quilt layers are not pinned or basted together?
                <ul>
                    <li>It is best to not have your quilt layers pinned or basted together. When we mount your quilt to the frame, each layer moves independently. If your quilt happens to be attached together, there may possibly be tucks or gathers on the underside of the quilt. Once again, we will do our best workmanship.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="bold italicize">Have you enclosed a plastic bag along with the completed Quilt Order Form if mailing?
                <ul>
                    <li>When mailing, be sure to enclose your quilt in a plastic bag along with the completed Quilt Order Form and insurance, and you will receive a tracking number. You will be notified upon receipt of your quilt either by email or phone. We haven't had any problems with the postal service or UPS, but why take a chance? Upon returning your quilt, it will be in a plastic enclosure and insured for the full value.

            <q>Thank you soooooooo much. It is beautiful and I can not wait for my husband to come home and see it on the bed. You really did a beautiful job. I have a label and I am excited to affix it on the back. I am the proud owner of a quilt that Ann Morgan Quilted!!!!! It is wonderful. I really love the designs. Can't wait to show it off at work tomorrow!!!</q>

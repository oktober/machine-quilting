            <q>I was very pleased with your work. You helped me very much with my first big project. I would certainly recommend you to others! Thank you for all your help!</q>

            <q>As always, Ann does an impeccable job with both design and technique. The quilt required a lot of time and effort from me to piece and I appreciate her taking equal time and effort to help in creating a treasured keepsake. Thanks Ann!</q>
